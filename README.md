## What is Cloud Code for Visual Studio Code

The goal is to provide great and opinionated developer experience for building Kubernetes and Cloud Native applications from Visual Studio Code.  We want to help with all part of the developer experience.  From creating a new application, expanding that application, to deploying and live debugging it.

In many ways the whole goal of Cloud Code for Visual Studio Code is to let you focus on your code versus needing to loose context and drop to a CLI, portal or some other tool for very common tasks.  As a result we have worked hard to ensure you can work like you normally would in VS Code.

## What Can I Do?

This guide is designed to highlight core features in Cloud Code for Visual Studio Code.  Each section has additional supporting docs linked and there is a catch-all section for cool features not sufficiently covered elsewhere.


1. Start by [setting up your machine and installing our extensions](getting_started.md)
    1. While you are getting set up take a quick look at the [FAQ](FAQ.md).
1. Try creating a [cluster in the cloud](create_cluster.md#google-kubernetes-engine) or a [local cluster with minikube](create_cluster.md#minikube-support).
1. Create a [new Kubernetes Application](create_application.md) from our samples.
1. [Deploy your new application](deploy.md) locally or to the cloud.
1. [Live debug](debugging.md) your application where ever it's running.
1. Take a [deep look into your Kubernetes cluster](kubernetesExplorer.md) with our cluster explorer.
    1.  If you are using GKE you can also [list and interact with GKE clusters](gke_explorer.md)
1. Take a look at the features we have to [simplify working with Kubernetes YAML](k8s_yaml.md)
1. Want to see more? Look through all of the [additional commands](commands.md) we support
